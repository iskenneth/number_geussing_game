OOP Concepts Applied

ðŸ”¹ 1. Encapsulation
All game logic is contained within the `NumberGuessing` class, such as checking guesses and updating the UI.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Abstraction
The user interacts with the program easily through input fields and buttons. Internal operations like number generation are hidden.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Inheritance
This project does not directly use inheritance. However, it could be extended by creating a parent `GameWindow` class and inheriting it in future games.

 ðŸ”¹ 4. Polymorphism
While not shown in this version, polymorphism could be implemented by adding different game modes using the same method names.
